The purpose of this work is to study the thermal evolution of intrusive bodies formed by
successive sills injection in different levels of the crust, taking into account the phase change
and latent heat release in a finite temperatures interval. Our numerical models involve heat
transfer only by conduction. Thermal evolution of the system is found with the energy balance
equation of enthalpy that includes phase and composition change of magmas.
